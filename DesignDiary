I was thinking about doing some analysis on the data that you gave for the grades but did not really get into it. I instead saw plenty of videos on data analysis so that I can get the feel on how to analyze data and some steps I can take. I analyzed data on pokemon, air quality, and on a company that sold items. This hole experience was really fun because I found out that I love to analyze data and have started looking into what tools I need to become a data analyst. The hardest part about this was thinking about a question on what I should analyze what I got from the tutorials was that I should instead break down the problem into smaller steps and think about how I can use pandas to accomplish these steps. The most challenging aspect about this assignment was trying to find functions that pandas has to try and implement the analysis(Pandas can do so much and is powerful when combined with matplotlib to represent the result that was found). I would tell future students to not be scared and really dive into the pandas library because not only is it fun but really helpful and can save you a lot of time when analyzing data. Again this assingment was really fun to me because I feel like this is what I want to do in the future as a career.
